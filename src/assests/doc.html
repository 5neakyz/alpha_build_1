<h3>The ML Unit Multi Stager</h3>
<p>
  The Stager is a crudely put together Python Application. To be able to
  configure multiple ML units at once.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  For connecting to a COM port and staging units you will get the results of the
  outcome in the following red / green format:
</p>
<p>
  <span style="background-color: #217346; color: #ffffff">Green</span>
  - Success: Connection Established, Staged Successfully
</p>
<p>
  <span style="background-color: #b40d1b; color: #ffffff">Red</span>
  - Failure: Cannot Establish Connection, Staging Failed
</p>
<p>
  For the Stager to successfully establish a connection with an ML unit, it must
  be able to read the main menu.<br />
  <em
    >So, a connection failure may not necessarily be an indication of a faulty
    connection or lack of power, but a unit behaving erratically
  </em>
</p>
<p>Baud rate is 115200<br />File Transfer Protocol is Xmodem1k</p>
<p>
  If you select to push either Firmware or Personality, The Stager will
  <strong>Erase Config</strong> before pushing anything.<br />
  If you are only pushing a BLE file it will <strong><u>Not</u></strong> Erase
  Config<br />
  <em
    >This is to prevent cases were the unit locks up as firmware and personality
    are not compatible.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  The exact file size and the exact number of bytes sent may not precisely
  match. But it is still a good indication of progress.
