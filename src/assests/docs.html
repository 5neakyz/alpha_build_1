        Select the com ports of the devices you need, you can unselect by

      </p>
      <p>
        Then press the connect button - wait for all Coms to to be displayed

      <ul>
        <li>Green - ML is alive and talking</li>
        <li>Red - Cannot talk to ML</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You need to unselect any that return RED and press the connect button
        again
      </p>
      <p>Now you can select the option you whish to run on the ML</p>
      <p>
        You then click the select firmware / personality can pick what you need.

        Once all the Ports are green the run command will now be active and you

      <p>
        You will see the &quot;Running...&quot; label above the button to

      </p>
      <p>
        once the command is done below the button will return if the command was

      <p>The selection box returns all the ports on the PC</p>
      <p>
        when pressing connect the COMs will return at different points, if they
        fail and return red this usually takes a noticeable amount of time, this
        is because i try multiple times to get to the menu over a few seconds
      </p>
      <p>
        please note that if it returns red this could be from a number of
        reasons, for example the ML might be on but with low voltage, i
        currently do not check for this, and so because i cannot get to the main
        menu when its talking with &quot;to low voltage&quot; i take that as a
        fail
      </p>
      <p>
        if you do not select a file but try to push firmware or personality
        nothing will happen, my code catch's that there is no file and will very
        quickly return this as red
      </p>
      <p>
        also note that pushing firmware takes about 70-80 seconds, but once its
        pushed it then takes the ML 10-15 seconds to install, and this locks the
        ML up now i currently wait 20 seconds then about every second for 5
        seconds do i try to get back to main menu to then push personality, if
        the ML takes too long it might return as a fail but the firmware will
        have been pushed but the personality will not have,
      </p>
      <p>
        I do check personality and firmware, ie i check that the xmodem push is
        successful then for personality, I check thats its not empty &quot;No
        Config&quot; and for firmware i get the Version from the file name and
        look at that in the status screen, please note that if the file naming
        convention changes then its might not read correctly and will fail at
        this point
      </p>
      <p>when pushing firmware I first clear personality</p>
